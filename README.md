Hi, I'm Dorianne and I am a Product Designer.
I would like to be able to develop the websites I design, so I am currently learning web design and front-end skills.
I decided to put what I have learn as a beginner in practice by taking part in challenges on the website https://devchallenges.io/
This is what I did for the challenge: Minimal blog card.
Hope that it is good enough!
